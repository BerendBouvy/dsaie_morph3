To do:
- [x] Function Water detection surrounding area
- [x] Function Distance to nearest water
    - []Decision on how to handle initial distance, in case that land and water pixel are next to each other. Now the distance from center of each pixel to the next is taken
- [x] Function angle to nearest water
- [x] Function width of the river in direction of nearest water pixel
    - Has problems with some angles WIP! Fixed
- [] Function to extract parameters for each pixel and store them in dataframe/csv.
    - Parameters needed for landpixel within 350m of a water pixel
    - Amount of water to be determined within 300 m of the landpixel
- [] Class for neural network
