# .gitignore is a file that tells Git which files (or patterns) it should ignore.
# This is useful to avoid committing temporary files, build artifacts, or sensitive information.

# To ignore a file or directory, simply add its name or path relative to the root of the repository.
# For example, to ignore a file named 'secret.txt', add:
# secret.txt

# To ignore all files with a specific extension, use the wildcard '*'.
# For example, to ignore all .log files, add:
# *.log

# To ignore a directory and all its contents, add a trailing slash.
# For example, to ignore a directory named 'build', add:
# build/

# To ignore files or directories in a specific subdirectory, specify the path.
# For example, to ignore all .tmp files in the 'temp' directory, add:
# temp/*.tmp

# To unignore a file or directory that was previously ignored, use the '!' character.
# For example, to ignore all .log files except 'important.log', add:
# *.log
# !important.log

# Comments can be added to the .gitignore file by starting the line with a '#'.
# These comments are ignored by Git and can be used to explain the purpose of the rules.
# For example:
# ignore data folder:
data/
*.pyc
